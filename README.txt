Introduction for the code

#1. How to use

*a. Run TSP_EA/Main.main, start experiment1 (3*4*10=120 rounds of running), and the result is in Experiment1_result.txt

*b. Run TSP_EA/BestOne.main, start experiment2 (test of the best implementation), and the result is in Experiment2_result.txt

*c. Run TSP_EA/TSPProblem.main, as a demonstration, to get a possible solution (printer output)

d. package CrossoverOperate contains different crossover operators
    package Mutation contains different mutation operators
    package Selection contains different select operators
    package Representation contains the implementation of Individual and Population.

e. we have designed three different Genetic Algorithms in the package GeneticAlgorithm
